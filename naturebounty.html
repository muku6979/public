<h1>Nature's Bounty</h1>
    <p1>Untouched nature in all its splendour is what Uttarakhand offers visitors. The state has been blessed with gorgeous natural beauty. The fact that almost 45.43 per cent of its geographical area has a dense forest cover, makes it all the more remarkable. The state is host to the mighty Himalayas, which guarantee a rich growth of flora and fauna, a pleasant climate and a peaceful and serene environment. The many glaciers here are sources of some of the major rivers of India, including the Ganga and the Yamuna. Snow-covered mountain peaks, like Nanda Devi, Badrinath, and Kamet, offer stunning views, while oak, rhododendron, deodar, and pine forests leave one in awe.</p1>
